I sorted references to memory in dataset using program sort.py.

before sorting: hit/miss = 1.07
after sorting: hit/miss = 2.87
Thus, I enforced locality principle by making references in neighboring instructions
So, after that the hit/miss ratio have increased, i.e. there are more hits than misses.
By shuffling memory refernces we, in general, will obtain lower hit/miss ratio

Another way to increase hit/miss ratio is to load as many pages as possible when program
starts to run (switched to). 
These >=n first memory references will result in hit.
