Physical address is an address in RAM, i.e. the real address in hardware where some word(or bit, or bite)
is stored.
Virtual address is an address that OS tells a program its data is stored in. In such a way
a program can use bigger address space than hardware can provide.
If computer has virtual memory, almost always virtual address will not be the same as physical address.

To access data stored in a physical address, we can just send this address to the bus.
To access data stored in a virtual address, we firstly need to map it to physical address.
